A fun little extension I made that helps me look up a company's reviews easily on Glassdoor, Comparably, and Indeed.

COMING SOON
- firefox support
- gifs showing how to use
- new images

Bugs
- sometimes when you highlight a company on indeed, it includes more than the company name, very rare.

v2.1 4-16-24
- removed Linkedin (not great for company reviews)
- added Comparably support.
